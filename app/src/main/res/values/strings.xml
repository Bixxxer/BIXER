    <string name="about_us">
       I am amateur programmer from Moscow. I started programming for fun back in 2012, and it became my primary hobby throughout our adolescence.\n Then, in 2014, I entered Lyceum of Information\n Technologies #1533 based in Moscow, where I chose programming as profile subject.\n
I use this app to present our work and share everything we learn.\n My goal is to collect everything I consider useful within one place.\n I also want to help people become interested in blockchain.\n
I strongly believe in revolution in modern life, which made people able to be really free, with using blockchain as the main techonology for decentralising.\n A lot of lectures are being organized in the city you and I live in.\n So, I do my best to encourage people to pay more attention to blockchain.\n Vlad Sedov.
